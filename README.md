#Passport reader
- Two different models implemented to read the text from passport images tesseract orc and paddleorc. 
- Paddleorc generated more accurate results than compared to tesseract orc.
- Combination of Image preprocessing methods resulted slightly accurate output.
  - Preprocessing used: Greyscale(cv2.cvtColor()), thresholding(cv2.threshold()), denoising(cv2.GaussianBlur())
